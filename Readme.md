# Battery measuring 
These are a set of programs which can be used to measure batteries with high accuracy.
Main focus is on measurments for low-budget batteries supplying low-power loads.

Implementations are in MATLAB .m controlling a *Keysight B2902A* Source Measurment Unit (SMU) using SCPI commands.
Measurements are programmed to be done using 4-wire Kelvin connections.
